tornado-slacker
===============

This package provides an easy API for moving the work out of
the tornado process / event loop.

Currently implemented methods are:

* execute the code in another server's http hook
  (django implementation is included);
* execute the code in a separate thread;
* dummy immediate execution.

API example::

    from django.contrib.auth.models import User
    from slacker import adisp
    from slacker import Slacker
    from slacker.workers import DjangoWorker

    AsyncUser = Slacker(User, DjangoWorker())

    @adisp.process
    def process_data():

        # all the django ORM is supported; the query will be executed
        # on remote end, this will not block the IOLoop
        users = yield AsyncUser.objects.filter(is_staff=True)[:5]
        print users

(pep-342 syntax and adisp library are optional, callback-style code
is also supported)


Installation
============

::

    pip install tornado-slacker

Slackers
========

Slackers are special objects that are collecting operations (attribute
access, calls, slicing) without actually executing them. Callables arguments
must be picklable. Slackers also provide a method to apply the collected
operations to a base object.

Any picklable object (including top-level functions and classes) can
be wrapped into Slacker, e.g.::

    from slacker import adisp
    from slacker import Slacker
    from slacker.workers import ThreadWorker

    def task(param1, param2):
        # do something blocking and io-bound
        return results

    async_task = Slacker(task, ThreadWorker())

    # pep-342-style
    @adisp.process
    def process_data():
        results = yield async_task('foo', 'bar')
        print results

    # callback style
    def process_data2():
        async_task('foo', 'bar').proceed(on_result)

    def on_result(results):
        print results


Parallel task execution is supported by adisp library::

    def _task1(param1, param2):
        # do something blocking
        return results

    def _task2():
        # do something blocking
        return results

    # worker can be reused
    worker = ThreadWorker()
    task1 = Slacker(_task1, worker)
    task2 = Slacker(_task2, worker)

    @adisp.process
    def process_data():
        # this will execute task1 and task2 in parallel
        # and return the result after all data is ready
        res1, res2 = yield task1('foo', 'bar'), task2()
        print res1, res2

.. note::

    this will fail with ``DjangoWorker`` and django development server
    because django development server is single-threaded

Python modules also can be Slackers::

    import shutil
    from slacker import Slacker
    from slacker.workers import ThreadWorker

    shutil_async = Slacker(shutil, ThreadWorker())
    op = shutil_async.copy('file1.txt', 'file2.txt')
    op.proceed()

Workers
=======

Workers are classes that decides how and where the work should be done:

* ``slacker.workers.DummyWorker`` executes code in-place (this
  is blocking);

* ``slacker.workers.ThreadWorker`` executes code in a thread from
  a thread pool;

* ``slacker.workers.HttpWorker`` pickles the slacker, makes an async
  http request with this data to a given server hook and expects it
  to execute the code and return pickled results;

  .. note::

      IOLoop blocks on any CPU activity and making http requests plus
      unpickling the returned result can cause a significant overhead
      here. So if the query is fast (e.g. database primary key or index
      lookup, say 10ms) then it may be better not to use tornado-slacker
      and call the query in 'blocking' way: the overall blocking time
      may be less than with 'async' approach because of reduced
      computations amount.

      It is also wise to return as little as possible if HttpWorker is used.


* ``slacker.workers.DjangoWorker`` is just a HttpWorker with default
  values for use with bundled django remote server hook implementation
  (``slacker.django_backend``).

  In order to enable django hook, include 'slacker.django_backend.urls'
  into urls.py and add SLACKER_SERVER option with server address to
  settings.py.

  SLACKER_SERVER is '127.0.0.1:8000' by default so this should work for
  development server out of box.

  .. warning::

      Do not expose django server hook to public, this is insecure!
      The best way is to configure additional server instance to listen
      some local port (e.g. bind it to the default 127.0.0.1:8000 address).

  .. note::

      Django's QuerySet arguments like Q, F objects, aggregate and annotate
      functions (e.g. Count) are picklable so tornado-slacker can handle
      them fine::

          AsyncAuthor = Slacker(Author, DjangoWorker())

          # ...
          qs = AsyncAuthor.objects.filter(
                  Q(name='vasia') or Q(is_great=True)
               ).values('name').annotate(average_rating=Avg('book__rating'))[:10]

          authors = yield qs

      Using slacker.Slacker is better than pickling queryset.query
      (as adviced at http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/querysets/#pickling-querysets)
      because this allows to pickle any ORM calls including ones that
      don't return QuerySets (http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/querysets/#methods-that-do-not-return-querysets)::

          yield AsyncUser.objects.create_superuser('foo')

      Moreover, slacker.Slacker adds transparent support for remote invocation
      of custom managers and model methods, returning just the model instance
      attributes, etc.
